### More general topics and suggestions

There is a [new STM8 board](https://www.stm32duino.com/viewforum.php?f=76)
in the stm32duino forum. So far, there is not much going on there, but it is
still the place to go to.

Please note that after registering on that forum, you are
**required** to post an introduction in the new user board first in order to
aquire the right to post or reply in any other board. Roger is strict on
that.
