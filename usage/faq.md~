## Compilation issues

### ASlink-Warning-No definition of area SSEG

This happens when there is no *.pde or *.ino file in the project directory,
`Serial_begin()` is not used and only *.c files are compiled.

This message means that main.c is not pulled in by the linker because there
was no reference to main() anywhere. When processing *.pde/ino files
`wrapper/sdcc.sh` (for IDE builds) or `Arduino.mk` (for Makefile builds) adds
a reference to main:

```
/* add a dummy reference to main() to make sure to pull in main.c from the core library */
void main(void);
void (*dummy_variable) () = main;
```

If there is no pde/ino file the user has to make sure main.c is pulled in by
the linker or define its own main().

Possible ways to pull in main.c:

- Use Serial_begin(): This references the variable runSerialEvent which in turn pulls in main.c (some overhead)
- reference the variable runSerialEvent yourself: `begin(){runSerialEvent=0;}` (Overhead: 4 bytes flash)
- add a reference to main() like above. (Overhead: 2 bytes RAM and 2 bytes flash)
- define your own main() function.


### Flashing fails on the new board

It might be locked/write protected. [Check
this](../../hardware/stm8blue/#unlocking-a-write-protected-mcu)


## Hardware issues


### My new stm8blue board seems dead and does not respond to the flash tool

***Crap alert:*** Due to bad PCB production quality, some more recent lots
of the stm8blue boards seem to have either no working connection to GND on
the SWIM connector or a short circuit from the SWIM pin to GND.

![A nasty short to GND](bad-etching.jpg)The SWIM pin is shortend to GND

Try connecting GND to the other GND board pin or power the board via USB.

Most freshly shipped boards come with a pre-programmed blinky. If the LED
blinks when the board is powered via USB but doesn't when it is only
connected to the flash tool, your board is probably missing the GND
connection.
